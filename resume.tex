	{\bf znanja Inc.} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}
	{\sl Co-CTO \& Co-Founder} \hfill {January 2012 -- present}
	\\
		My role at znanja is partially a continuation of my work at Velsoft. znanja is an eLearning platform, content conversion, and content delivery platform that allows instructors and facilitators to create, convert and deliver their content in real-time, and deliver it to their students in an easy, customizable and effective way. My responsibilities at znanja as Co-CTO are to work with the rest of the engineering, marketing and sales team team to define and develop a top-notch eLearning platform. This platform is built using a multitude of technologies including: Linux, SmartOS (Solaris 10), Python, Node.JS, PHP, C++, JavaScript.

	{\bf Velsoft Training Materials Inc.} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}
	{\sl Head of Technology \& Sr Software Developer} \hfill {\bf April 2010 -- present}
	\\
		My role at Velsoft is a varied one, and one that is always changing and expanding. My chief responsibility here is as a software and infrastructure engineer. In this role, I work with our development and our systems team to develop amazing eLearning applications on our custom build eLearning platform, while enhancing and expanding the platform itself. This affords me a great deal of experience with the entire stack, ranging from our Linux and Solaris servers, to the Python, C++, NodeJS and PHP code-base. Given that we deal with large amounts of content and data, we are always finding and developing ways of viewing, and analysing that data to provide a comprehensive overview of our platform's health, customer's content, student responses and scoring, overall customer strategies and an suite of advanced data management tools.
\newpage
		Additional to my role as an engineer, I also manage the team of software and systems engineers and the over infrastructure that they rely on, on a day-to-day basis, including both our internal infrastructure, and our external infrastructure. Our existing internal infrastructure exists in-house, and consists of all types of servers ranging from our directory server (Active Directory on Windows Server 2008 R2) to our project management suite (the Atlassian suite including JIRA, Confluence and Bamboo) and our development infrastructure. Our external interface exists on a combination of Amazon AWS (EC2, S3, Route53) and Joyent's SmartDataCenter hosted privately. My team also manages internal services such as VPN, GPO and workstation management, and customer facing services behind OAuth 2.0, such as our Courses API and our eLearning API.

%	At Velsoft, one of my responsibilities is for the deployment, administration and upkeep of the network infrastructure both internally and externally. This includes administrating, or overseeing many Linux servers, and several Windows 2008 R2 servers some of which of each are in an Active Directory forest that is shared with client computers internally. These computers interact with a number of network resources including a VPN for developers, a file server, printer server, development servers, application servers and project management with wiki suite to provide a comprehensive network environment suitable for large scale collaboration, planning, development and testing.
	
%	Additionally, I lead a team of developers in both their day-to-day software maintenance, software development and on a number of large scale projects. As the senior developer, I am responsible for planning, developing and deploying a scalable eLearning platform using OAuth 2.0 for content delivery, a number of different packaging formats (including SCORM 1.2) for interoperability and a built-in-house learning management system (``LMS'') to deliver eLearning as a software as a service (``SaaS'') solution. This role includes deploying and configuring any required services including Apache, MySQL, MongoDB, memcache and Subversion on a large cluster of servers, hosted on Amazon's AWS platform. The system is set up in an effective and efficient manner so as to serve hundreds of thousands of requests per-day. Additional projects include in-house applications for sales and marketing, and developing an API to interact with both our master courses database and our master SCM that houses our course content.

	Velsoft has provided me the opportunity to build and develop scalable, high-use applications built on a number of technologies, including NodeJS, and Amazon's AWS cloud. At Velsoft I have been given the opportunity to grow both as a developer, and as a manager. I have managed and developed with large teams, and small teams. I have also lead in the release of patches back to the open source community, and the open sourcing of many of the libraries we use internally.

	{\bf Freelance and Open-Souce Developer} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
	{\sl Web Developer and Consultant} \hfill {\bf 2004 -- present}\\
	I have been working as a freelance and open-source developer for a number of years, and have worked on many open-source projects, including as co-lead developer on the Cerenkov framework (now defunct). I have developed numerous websites using this framework including the Leapnode IRC Network website (\href{http://leapnode.net}{http://leapnode.net}). I also have experience with other frameworks, including the Zend Framework, and KohanaPHP. 

	I have done PHP Development work for some local and non-local companies including;

	{\sl Student System Administrator (Intern)} \hfill {\bf January 2010 -- April 2010 (1 semester)}\\
	My role at the Technology Support Group for my last semester at St. Francis Xavier University was on the Projects Team of the Infrastructure Technology department. I had been tasked with multiple projects, from researching virtualization technologies such as VMWare to researching and testing Windows 7 and Windows 2008 Server rollout options on a large scale to all of the client computer labs (using KMS and MAK for activation). As a \textit{student system administrator}, I interacted daily the Manager of Technology Infrastructure and provided suggestions on a number of projects.

	{\sl Software Developer (Intern)} \hfill {\bf July 2009 -- Aug 2009 (summer term)}\\
	With Gatermaster, Inc. I was responsible for helping build a new "Internet Rental Listings" website, where landlords and tenants could connect with each other in new ways. One of the tasks I was charged with was creating the Tenant ``Application Centre'' where applicant tenants could create and store information on their application. Along with the ``Application Centre'', I was also partially responsible (together with the Sr. Software Developer) for helping put the system together in its entirety. The development work was mainly in PHP, though there was a significant amount of JavaScript (using the jQuery library). The database used to store and process the large amount of information was Firebird.

%	At TheU.ca, I am responsible for developing and maintaining TheU.ca websites, sub-websites (such as the Frosh site), and all services offered over Internet (or local network), along with updating and maintaining TheU.ca’s servers (the web server running CentOS 5.3, the development server running Debian 5.0 and the file server running OS X Server) under the direction of the VP-Communications. I was responsible for creating and maintaining the Frosh Week website, the Frosh Kit Distrobution system, as well as the photo gallery, as well as setting up and maintaining the file server and backup solution. A voting system my partner Ben and I created was utilized in the latest Student Union elections polling stations to ensure that voting was fair and that people were properly tracked. The St. Francis Xavier Students' Union has the largest voter turnout of any Canadian University.

	At the TSG, I was responsible for answering calls, emails and faxes to assist with the TSGs regular duties around the University, as they are responsible for nearly all the technology on campus. My duties involved helping to troubleshoot users with any problems, updating assigned student's accounts passwords, as well as documentation on subjects concerning the technologies that the TSG has implemented.
